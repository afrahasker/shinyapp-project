# NYC Flights Weather Sensitivity

This Shiny app allows users to explore the delay sensitivity levels of
all flights routes varying by weather factors like precipitation, wind, and
visibility. Filters are available for different origin and destination 
combinations, as well as the option to choose from three weather variables.
The app then displays a visual plot of the delay sensitivity for the top 20 
flight routes dependent on the weather factor selected, along with a table
version.

To run the app locally:
1) Install R Studio
2) Install required packages (shiny, tidyverse, nycflights13)
3) Open the app.R file in Rstudio and click Run App
